## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the Corona pandemic.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people so that after the quarantine situation ends across the nation it can leverage its data to advance itself and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
-It is required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- StatsModel
- SKLearn

## Conclusions
- The bike sharing demand has increased from 2018 to 2019, implies we should be much more attentive in improving the services as the demand is increasing yearly. 
- The demand for bike sharing is high in 5th-9th month. So, we can concentrate on advertisements and Discounts from 10th month, to increase the bike sharing services. 
- We can also go through vehicle modifications or repair issues in During Spring (Jan-April) Season as this is the season where we have less demand, and we expect more demand right after this season (based on the previous data).
- The Machine Learning Model that we have build was able to predict the performance of the company services with a Training R2 score of 82% and Test score of 79%
